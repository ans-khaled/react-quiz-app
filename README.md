🚀 Core Features
📦 Dynamic Questions (Fake API Integration)

Custom-built fake API for quiz questions.

Questions are fetched dynamically when the app starts using useEffect.

🎚️ Filter by Difficulty

Users can filter questions by: All, Easy, Medium, or Hard.

Each difficulty level has its own point value, providing a more realistic quiz experience.

🧠 Global State with Context API

Implemented React Context API to manage global quiz state without prop drilling.

Context manages:

Current question index

User answers

Quiz progress

Score & highscore

Selected difficulty filter

Entire app reads state cleanly using useContext.

🏆 Dynamic Scoring System

Scores are calculated based on question difficulty.

Highscore is stored and updated across quiz attempts.

🔁 Review Mode

After finishing the quiz, users can review all their answers.

Navigation between questions using Next and Previous buttons.

🧩 Modular & Reusable Components

Clean folder structure and naming conventions.

UI components are reusable, composable, and separated from logic.

Easy to scale and maintain.
