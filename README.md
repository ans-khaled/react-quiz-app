🚀 Core Features

📦 Fake API Integration

• Created a custom fake API for quiz questions.

• Used useEffect to fetch and render questions dynamically when the app starts.

🎚️ Filter by Difficulty

• Users can filter questions by difficulty level: All, Easy, Medium, or Hard.

• Each difficulty level affects the points assigned to the question.

🏆 Dynamic Scoring System

• Each question has a specific point value based on difficulty.

• After completing the quiz, the user sees their final score and highest score (highscore) if they play multiple times.

🔁 Review Mode

• After finishing the quiz, users can review their answers.

• Navigate between questions using Next and Previous buttons to see all responses.

🧩 Clean & Reusable Components

• Components are well-organized with clear naming conventions.

• Implemented component composition and children props to make UI parts flexible and maintainable.
